*** Requirements ***

Lazarus version:
We guarantee the latest FastReport to work only on the latest version of Lazarus.
*It may run on earlier versions, but we can't guarantee it.
This means that when you update Lazarus, you must also update FastReport.
Conversely, when you update FastReport, you must also update Lazarus.

For Linux:
Widget Library(Tools->Configure "Build Lazarus"->LCL widget Type):
We develop and test "FastReport for Lazazarus" for GTK2 only.

*** Preparation ***

Linux:

sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev

Windows:

Download "Precompiled Binaries for Windows" of the required bit-type:
https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
From the downloaded archive copy the contents to C:Windows\System32 and C:Lazarus, then reboot Windows.
